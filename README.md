# Android Temp Folder Cleaner

## Overview

Are you worried about accidentally deleting important files while trying to clean up temporary folders from your Android projects? This Python script provides a safe and efficient solution to help you delete only specific temporary folders (`app/build`, `.gradle`, `.idea`, and `app/release`) without compromising other files. Simply select the root directory containing your projects, and the script will handle the rest.

## Features

- **Selective Deletion**: Targets only specified temporary folders in all subdirectories.
- **Threaded Operations**: Utilizes threading for faster processing across multiple project folders.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use dialog for selecting the root directory.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback on successfully deleted folders and any issues encountered.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/android-temp-folder-cleaner.git
   cd android-temp-folder-cleaner
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. No additional libraries are needed; Tkinter comes with standard Python installations.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python cleaner.py
   ```

2. A dialog window will open prompting you to select the root folder containing your Android projects.

3. After selecting the directory, the script will search for and delete the specified temporary folders within each project, displaying messages in the console for any folders successfully deleted.

4. **Important**: Ensure that you review the folders that will be deleted and use this script with caution to avoid accidental loss of important data.

## Example

If you have the following folder structure:

```
/Users/hasnat/Documents/
└── Android/
    ├── Project1/
    │   ├── app/
    │   └── .gradle/
    ├── Project2/
    │   ├── app/
    │   └── .idea/
    └── Project3/
        └── app/
```

After running the script and selecting the `Android` directory, the script will safely delete:
- `/Users/hasnat/Documents/Android/Project1/app/build`
- `/Users/hasnat/Documents/Android/Project1/.gradle`
- `/Users/hasnat/Documents/Android/Project2/.idea`
- `/Users/hasnat/Documents/Android/Project3/app/release`
